# vagrant-ansible-example

The Vagrant Ansible provisioner allows you to provision the guest using Ansible playbooks by executing ansible-playbook from the Vagrant host.

## Requirements

* Install Ansible on your Vagrant host.

If installing Ansible directly on the Vagrant host is not an option in your development environment, you might be looking for the Ansible Local provisioner alternative.
